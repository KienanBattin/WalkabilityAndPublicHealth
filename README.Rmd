## How to set up your workspace

1. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup
2. Download and install GitHub desktop from https://desktop.github.com/
3. Follow the prompts to sign in to the desktop client using the account you created in step 1
4. Clone the repository by selecting "File -> Clone repository"
5. Select the "URL" tab
6. Paste the repository url in the search box "https://github.com/lgodmer-tepper/WalkabilityAndPublicHealth.git"
7. Select the local path where you want to clone the repository to on your device.
8. Click "Clone" 

Now you have a local copy of the files from the "main" branch. 
The "main" branch is the latest version of the files that have been reviewed and accepted by the team. 

## Making changes

To make changes you will want to follow this process

1. Create a branch
2. Author your changes and test them
3. Create a "pull request" to merge the changes to the "main" branch
4. Request your teammates to review the changes.
5. When all teammates have reviewed the changes you can merge them into the "main" branch.
